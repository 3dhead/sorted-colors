# Sorted CSS Colors

I wanted to create a tool to sort named CSS colors in a way that it shows related colors together. So, next time I can't decide between a few CSS colors, I can just check them here side by side.

## Credits

- Table of colors, which I used for parsing color data, is taken from [Eric Meyer's website](https://meyerweb.com/eric/css/colors/) and then modified a bit to serve the purpose better.

- Back Icon is from [Iconfinder](https://www.iconfinder.com/icons/326518/arrow_back_icon)
